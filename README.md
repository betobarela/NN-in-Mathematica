This project is a very simple endeavor whose goal is to get hands-on familiarity with the algorithm of backpropagating Artificial Neural Networks, i.e., the multilayer perceptron. We implement fitting through minibatches and allow for arbitrary architecture (of dense layers, of course). 

We implement it in Python and Mathematica. The version in Python is much more efficient.
